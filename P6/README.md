You will need to run local server to render the visualizations. You can start a local server using Python. Navigate to the directory that contains all of the files and then type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the command line. If you type `http://localhost:8000` into the address bar of your browser, then you should see the files that you can display in the web page.
